core.js

core.js is a collection of useful functions that I have compiled
from my javascript projects.

At the heart of it is the "create" function, which provides a
versatile way to create and append dom objects.

core.js is, on principle, plain javascript -- no jQuery. This
ability to stand alone is useful if you can't use jQuery for
whatever reason. In such cases, functions like "ajax", albeit
much weaker than their jQuery counterparts, are nice to have.

I'm always tweaking the code in rather drastic ways, so I've
separated it out into version numbers to preserve some sanity in
the programs that depend on it. The file "core.js" is always the
most recent version.
